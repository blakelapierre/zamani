The complaint was given to me by an unidentified individual, who greeted me at the door of the house Kim and I rent, saying, "Sorry if this fucks up your night, dude". My nap in our front room was interrupted when the individual loudly banged on our door and then began yelling at me through our windows.

I confirmed in a phone call with Sogand Zamani, on February 12, 2018, that Sogand Zamani sent the unidentified individual to our house.



The complaint contains at least two false statements:

  1) Representation #5, "The parties separated on or about December 30, 2017 and have mutually and voluntarily lived separate and apart, without cohabitation or interruption, since that time."

  2) Footnote #1, "Plaintiff requests that the Court allow her to keep her current address confidential from Defendant due to Plaintiff's reasonable concerns for her safety stemming from Defendant's threatening and intimidating behavior towards her and her attorneys."


Further,

District of Columbia Code § 16–904 (cited by the complaint as D.C. Code §§ [...] 16-904) only provides for a grant of legal separation if:

  (1) both parties to the marriage have mutually and voluntarily lived separate and apart without cohabitation; or

  (2) both parties to the marriage have lived separate and apart without cohabitation for a period of one year next preceding the commencement of the action.



1) I have not mutually nor voluntarily separated nor have I mutually nor voluntarily lived separate from Kimberly. I have told Kimberly verbally and by e-mail that I have not voluntarily separated from her.

2) Kim and I have not lived separate or apart for a period of one year.

Further, I have not engaged in threatening or intimidating behavior towards Kim or any of her attorneys.



The first sentence of my first communication to Amanda Sow and Sogand Zamani, on January 29, 2018 was:

  > Marisa and Amanda,

  > Kim and I have not separated.


In an ongoing email conversation with Kim, on January 19, 2018, I sent Kim the following:

  > Kim,

  > I have not voluntarily separated from you.


Kim's response to that email was on January 28, 2018:

  > My attorney will be sending you an email and letter in the next few days.


If I had mutually and voluntarily separated from Kimberly, I would have joined in on this complaint, or, I would have filed a similar complaint myself.

In the complaint, Sogand Zamani undersigned a statement,

 "I solemnly swear or affirm under criminal penalties for the making of a false statement that I have read the foregoing Complaint for Legal Separation and that the factual statements made in it are true to the best of my personal knowledge, information and belief."

I ask this court to dismiss the complaint and to investigate 1) why Sogand Zamani undersigned a statement swearing or affirming under criminal penalties for the making of a false statement, despite the preceding pages of the document, containing the aforementioned undersigned statement, having at least two false statements; and, 2) why Sogand Zamani allowed Kimberly to undersign the same statement, despite the preceding pages having at least two false statements; and 3) why Sogand Zamani filed a complaint with this court that makes at least two false statements.

No hearing should be held on this complaint.


So I say,

Blake La Pierre
