Item 7 - False Claim / False Statement / False Statement to a Third Person / False Statement in an Apparent Court Filing - 2

    On February 11, 2018, I received, by an unidentified individual (they refused to identify themselves, even after my asking them to), papers that purport to be a Complaint filed by Sogand Zamani. The complaint makes at least two false statements (see 1).

    False statement 2:

      "1 Plaintiff requests that the Court allow her to keep her current address confidential from Defendant due to Plaintiff's reasonable concerns for her safety stemming from Defendant's threatening and intimidating behavior towards her and her attorneys."

    I have not engaged in threatening or intimidating behavior towards Kim or her attorneys. I don't believe anyone is more concerned for Kim's safety than I am.
