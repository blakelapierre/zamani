    _________________________________


      2.  On February 1, 2018, I received what I believed to be my first ever communication from Sogand Zamani, Esq.

    _________________________________


      3.  Sogand Zamani, Esq.'s communication (see Fact 2.) stated, among other statements:

          "As I made clear in my initial communication, I represent your wife and our communications with her are privileged."


    Complaint:  FALSE COMMUNICATION & APPARENT FALSE STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT TO A THIRD PERSON
    ----------

    In Sogand Zamani, Esq.'s communication (see Fact 2.) they claimed that a communication to me on January 29, 2018 (see ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 1 : BML), signed by Amanda Sow, Esq., and sent by electronic mail from Marisa Slifka, was actually from herself (Sogand Zamani, Esq.).
