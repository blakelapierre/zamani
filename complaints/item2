          Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule 4.1--Truthfulness in Statements to Others

          In the course of representing a client, a lawyer shall not knowingly:

    _________________________________


      2.  On February 1, 2018, I received what I believed to be my first ever communication from Sogand Zamani, Esq.

    _________________________________


      3.  Sogand Zamani, Esq.'s communication (see Fact 2.) stated, among other statements:

          "As I made clear in my initial communication, I represent your wife and our communications with her are privileged."


    Complaint:  FALSE COMMUNICATION & APPARENT FALSE STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT TO A THIRD PERSON
    ----------

    In Sogand Zamani, Esq.'s communication (see Fact 2.) they claimed that a communication to me on January 29, 2018 (see ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 1 : BML), signed by Amanda Sow, Esq., and sent by electronic mail from Marisa Slifka, was actually from herself (Sogand Zamani, Esq.).

    Additionally, in no prior communication that I have received was it ever claimed, or "made clear", that Sogand Zamani, Esq.'s, nor any other person's communications with Kimberly La Pierre are "privileged" (see Fact 3.).


    <see included image of false communication & apparent false statement>



    The Undersigned hereby certifies to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
    that the statements in the foregoing Complaint are true and correct to
    the best of my knowledge.
