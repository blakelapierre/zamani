Elizabeth A. Herman
Deputy Disciplinary Counsel,

Please confirm or deny that you received three complaints from me:

  ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 1 : BML
  ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 2 : BML
  ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 3 : BML


I have received two letters that appear to be signed by you:

  (1) Dated March 26, 2018
  (1) Dated April 20, 2018


Both letters reference:

  Sow/Pierre 2018-U089
  Zamani/La Pierre 2018-U090


I have included both letters with the package containing this letter. Please inform me if you did not receive the two letters.

Thank you for contacting me regarding the complaints I have sent to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. I had planned to write a response to you regarding the first letter I received, but you have written me again first. There appeared to be a small error in the first letter. In the first paragraph, it was written "Amanda G. Snow, Esquire". To the best of my knowledge, Amanda's "last name" is Sow. It appears that was a "typo", as I now see that "Sow" was used in the upper right portion of the letter after "Re:". I am curious why that line does not read "Sow/La Pierre", as the line below it reads "Zamani/La Pierre". If you know the answer, I'd be very thankful if you told me the answer, however I don't think it's something to prioritize in this matter.

Regarding the second letter, I think there are [at least x] errors. All three complaints have merit and need to be fully investigated.

  *) I did not state that Amanda, Sogand, "these attorneys", nor anyone made any representations. The word "representation", nor a derivative, does not occur in any of the complaints I have sent so far. I also have not used the phrase "civil matter" in any of the complaints so far.

  *) I did not state Ms. Sow and/nor Ms. Zamani informed me of anything. The word "inform" does not appear in any complaint I have sent so far.

  *) I have not stated in any complaint to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel that I have requested information from anyone nor that I have not received information.

I have not reported any ethical violation of Amanda or Sogand for requesting information from me nor for threatening to take further action. Not only have I requested communications from Sogand and Amanda, but I have also requested at least: recordings, transcripts, notes, and other work products. I still have not received any of those from Amanda or Sogand.

I have not objected to Amanda or Sogand's failure to respond to my request for communications. The word "respond" does not occur in any complaint I have sent to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. Rule `3.4--Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel` does not require a court order for a lawyer to be bound to not "Obstruct another party's access to evidence". I have asked to be able to access much "evidence", however I have been obstructed by Sogand and to some extent Amanda.

I have four additional complaints that are currently in draft form:

  ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 4 : BML
    - False Claim / False Statement to a Third Person
  ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 5 : BML
    - False Claim / False statement / False Statement to a Third Person
  ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 6 : BML
    - False Claim / False Statement / False Statement to a Third Person / False Statement in an Apparent Court Filing - 1
  ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 7 : BML
    - False Claim / False Statement / False Statement to a Third Person / False Statement in an Apparent Court Filing - 2

Disturbingly, there are even more violations, variously, by Amanda and Sogand. As of an email sent to Amanda, Sogand, and others, on March 21, 2018, I recorded the following violation counts (these include the previously sent and mentioned complaints):

  13 - Rule 4.1: FALSE STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT TO A THIRD PERSON (count excludes the following counts)
   1 - Rule 4.1: FALSE COMMUNICATION / FALSE STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT TO A THIRD PERSON
   1 - Rule 4.1: FALSE SUMMONS / FALSE STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT TO A THIRD PERSON
   1 - Rule 4.1: FALSE CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE / FALSE STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT TO A THIRD PERSON
   1 - Rule 3.4(a): FAILURE TO PRODUCE MATERIAL ARTIFACTS / OBSTRUCTION OF ANOTHER PARTY'S ACCESS TO EVIDENCE

However, and even more disturbingly, since then there have been even more violations. At least ten false statements of material fact were made by Sogand Zamani and were recorded and transcribed in Courtroom Number 104 at the Superior Court of the District of Columbia Family Division.

The above is not exhaustive of all violations by Sogand and Amanda. I will be sending complaints with the specifics of each violation, however, due to the number of violations and the priorities of my other tasks, I have not yet completed them. I expect to have them sent to you shortly as I believe this is a very urgent matter.

Do you currently have an open investigation regarding my second complaint? It is baffling that Sogand claims the letter apparently signed by Amanda was actually their own "initial communication to me". Sogand has given me no explanation for it. Have you contacted Sogand regarding my false communication complaint?

I am very sorry that we have to be going through this stuff. I tried my best to address these issues with Sogand and Amanda as soon as I was able, but clearly I have so far failed to correct them.


Thank you for attention in this matter.


Sincerely,

Blake La Pierre
