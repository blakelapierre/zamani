Item 5 - False Claim / False statement / False statement made to a third person

    On February 9, 2018, Sogand Zamani said to me, via electronic mail, "If you persist in making baseless allegations and do so in a filing, please know that we will of course take all appropriate action and seek attorneys fees from you for the absolute waste of time that would ensue. I suggest that you speak to an attorney as soon as possible."

    I have not made any baseless allegations. Sogand does not even identify one (1) allegation to which they refer. In an immediate follow up communication to Sogand Zamani, I inquired what was baseless about the complaints I had, which I had previously communicated to her.

    Sogand Zamani has not responded to my inquiry.
