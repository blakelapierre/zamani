    Complaint:  FAILURE TO PRODUCE MATERIAL ARTIFACTS
    ----------

    In Amanda Sow, Esq.'s and/or Sogand Zamani, Esq.'s communication (see Facts 5. and 6.) (see ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 1 : BML && ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 2 : BML) threatened to take legal action against me (see Fact 5.).

    They did not explain what they meant by "proceed accordingly" (see Fact 6.).

    Amanda Sow, Esq. and/or Sogand Zamani, Esq. are obstructing my access to evidence despite reasonably should have being known that materials I requested would be evidence, subject to discovery and/or subpoena, in whatever pending or imminent proceeding they had planned.

    Further, neither Amanda Sow, Esq. nor Sogand Zamani, Esq., nor any other person has claimed any applicable law under which the materials I requested are "privileged" (see Fact 7.) or "protected by the attorney-client privilege".

    Further, Amanda Sow, Esq. and/or Sogand Zamani, Esq. (see ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 1 : BML && ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - COMPLAINT 2 : BML) sought an "equitable" settlement. In an equitable settlement, there is no information gained by Amanda Sow, Esq. and/or Sogand Zamani, Esq. of which its disclosure would be embarrassing or detrimental to their client. In fact, disclosure of all information is required to achieve an equitable settlement.


    <see included request for materials & apparent denial (ZAMANI & ASSOCIATES PLLC - MATERIAL 3 & 4)>



    The Undersigned hereby certifies to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel
    that the statements in the foregoing Complaint are true and correct to
    the best of my knowledge.
