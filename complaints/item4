Item 4 - False claim / False statement made to a third person

  On February 5, 2018, Sogand Zamani said, via electronic mail, "We do not represent you and your insistence in several regards over email is alarming."

  I have never insisted, claimed, insinuated, or done any other thing that should, or could, be construed as a claim or insistence that Sogand Zamani, nor any other person, represents me, let alone, "in several regards".
