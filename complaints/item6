Item 6 - False Claim / False Statement / False Statement to a Third Person / False Statement in an Apparent Court Filing - 1

    On February 11, 2018, I received, by an unidentified individual (they refused to identify themselves, even after my asking them to), papers that purport to be a Complaint filed by Sogand Zamani. The complaint makes at least two false statements (see 2).

    False statement 1:

      "5. The parties separated on or about December 30, 2017 and have mutually and voluntarily lived separate and apart, without cohabitation or interruption, since that time."

    I have not mutually or voluntarily lived separate or apart from Kim. I have previously communicated this to Kim, before the false statement was filed. I have also communicated to Sogand Zamani and Amanda Sow that Kim and I have not separated, despite their initial claim.
