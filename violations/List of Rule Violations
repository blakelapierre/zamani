additional rules than those listed here have been violated or that would be violated if your representations were true
(e.g. Rule 3.4(d) & ostensibly, Rule 4.3(b), based on Sogand's representations).

   1 - Rule 4.1: FALSE COMMUNICATION / FALSE STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT TO A THIRD PERSON
   1 - Rule 4.1: FALSE SUMMONS / FALSE STATEMENT OF MATERIAL FACT TO A THIRD PERSON

    - FALSE CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE
      A "Certificate of Service" claimed that another document was previously sent to me, however the apparent document being referred to was in the same envelope as the "Certificate", making it impossible that it was sent according to the "Certificate".
